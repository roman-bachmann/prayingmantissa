# Backtracing Innovation
From Snapchat's Facial Recognition to the Inception of Semiconductors

### Abstract
The US Patent & Trademark Office, short USPTO, offers a full-fledged directed graph of US patent
citations since 1975. Many at the time obscure patents paved the way for groundbreaking new
technologies in the future, as for example Google's Page Rank (#6285999) or Apple's touch screen
devices (#7479949). In our project we endevor to visualize this massive graph, more than
89 Million edges, in an appealing and concise way in order to render the narration of more intricate
stories possible.

### Research questions
 - How to apply common graph algorithms to a massive data set?
 - How to efficiently travers and query a graph of that scale?
 - How to conveniently visualize a large and complicated graph?
 - How to draw conclusions about technology soley given patents and their citations?
 
### Dataset
 - [Patent citations](http://www.patentsview.org/api/doc.html)
 - [Google patents](https://www.google.ch/patents)

### A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
 - Refresh graph algorithms.
 - Sight data and perform preliminary analysis.
 - Find blog skeleton.
 - Discuss narrative of the data story.

### Questions for TAa
 - What technologies do professional data blogs like FiveThirtyEight use for visualisation?
