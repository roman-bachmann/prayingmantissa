# Backtracing Innovation
From Snapchat's Facial Recognition to the Inception of Semiconductors

### Abstract
The US Patent & Trademark Office, short USPTO, offers a full-fledged directed graph of US patent
citations since 1975. Many at the time obscure patents paved the way for groundbreaking new
technologies in the future, as for example Google's Page Rank (#6285999) or Apple's touch screen
devices (#7479949). In our project we endevor to visualize this massive graph with more than
89 Million edges in an appealing and concise way in order to render the narration of more
intricate stories possible and offer potential users a slick and interactive interface
for navigating the patents graph. Inspirations on how to beautifully draw a graph network
are taken from [Kirell Benzi](http://www.kirellbenzi.com). Those stories may range from analysing
node connectivities to extract influences of particular inventors to finding the
shortest walks between patents. Through this we hope to gain deeper insight into the
metastructure of inventions throughout digital revolution and how they shape the future
as we know it today.

### Research questions
 - How to apply common graph algorithms to a massive data set?
 - How to efficiently travers and query a graph of that scale?
 - How to visualize a large and complicated graph?
 - How to handle missing edges in the patent graph?
 - How to eliminate equal patents that were filed under several identifiers?
 - How to draw conclusions about technology soley given patents and their citations?
 
### Dataset
 - [USPTO patents database](http://www.patentsview.org/download)
 - [Google patents](https://www.google.ch/patents)

### A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
 - Refresh on graph algorithms.
 - Look for efficient graph processing libraries. Preferably with GPU integration.
 - Sight data and perform preliminary analysis.
 - Find blog skeleton.
 - Discuss narrative of the data story.

### Questions for TAa
 - What technologies do professional data blogs like FiveThirtyEight use for visualisation? 
 - What is [Kirell Benzi's](http://www.kirellbenzi.com) magic library?
