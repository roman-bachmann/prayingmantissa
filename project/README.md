#  Are food tweets an accurate representation of a regions diet

# Abstract
*A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?*

Social media has given us the possibility to carefully craft a public persona. We can decide to only show ourselves from the best side, which leads to a discrepancy between our actual behaviour and our online life.

Twitter is well known for being a platform where people like to talk about what they have just eaten. 

We would like to find out, if the food world of Twitter is an accurate image of the actual food consumption according to official government statistics. Further, we are interested in finding out if it is possible to infer socioeconomic information about people solely based on their food related tweets.
